\subsection{Shared DSP instructions}
\label{sec:spec:shared:dsp}

In the DSP extension, there is support for narrower (16-bit)
data types, which are useful when implementing some classes of
light-weight block cipher.

Here is listed a set of instructions which are {\em shared} with
the bitmanip extensions.
That is, someone implementing either the \XCRYPTO specifcation, or
the Bitmanip extension can use them.
The instruction functions and encodings remain identical across extensions.


{\bf Note:} From public presentations\footnote{

on the proposed DSP
extension, there are some instructions which have been identified as
useful for implementing light-weight block ciphers.
There is no publically available information on their encodings
or exact functionality however, so this section acts as a placeholder
until that becomes available.
In the mean time,
\REFSEC{sec:spec:instruction:2:4}
contains WIP specifications for these kinds of instructions.
