\subsection{More specific,  low(er)-level points}
\label{appx:discuss:lo}

\begin{itemize}

\item Instruction mnemonics follow a (somewhat) consistent scheme; they
      all include a domain-separating prefix \VERB[RV]{xc}, and, where
      need be, a suffix intended to identify specific variants.  These 
      include
      \[
      \begin{array}{lcl}
      \VERB[RV]{i} &:& \mbox{immediate (vs. register)   }        \\
      \VERB[RV]{u} &:& \mbox{updating  (vs. overwriting)}        \\
      \VERB[RV]{h} &:& \mbox{high}                               \\
      \VERB[RV]{l} &:& \mbox {low}                               \\
      \VERB[RV]{b} &:& \mbox    {byte-oriented}                  \\
      \VERB[RV]{h} &:& \mbox{halfword-oriented}                  \\
      \VERB[RV]{w} &:& \mbox    {word-oriented}                  \\
      \VERB[RV]{x} &:& \mbox{a size, length, or count parameter} \\
      \end{array}
      \]
\item Although they share a memory interface, there is no requirement for
      the host core and co-processor to share an address space.  Indeed,
      it is easy to imagine cases where using disjoint address spaces is
      useful; examples include use of
      a) an OTP-style memory for key storage, 
         or
      b) a (uncached) scratch-pad memory,
      by the co-processor alone.
\item Per \REFSEC{sec:spec:instruction:2:4}, 
      \VERB[RV]{xc.mix.l}
      and
      \VERB[RV]{xc.mix.h}
      use the immediate 
      $ 
      0 \leq \VERB[RV]{rtamt} < 16 
      $ 
      to right-rotate $\XCR[*][{\VERB[RV]{crs1}}]$ by $d$ bits where
      $0  \leq d < 16$
      and
      $16 \leq d < 32$
      respectively.
      The specification of {\em two} instructions vs. {\em one} that can
      deal with 
      $0  \leq d < 32$
      is motivated by instruction encoding: it is easier to avoid having
      a dedicated $5$-bit immediate field, reusing the existing $4$-bit
      field, e.g., as used by
      \VERB[RV]{xc.bop}.

\subsection{More  generic, high(er)-level points}
\label{appx:discuss:hi}

\begin{itemize}

\item Lee and Fiskiran introduce (e.g., see~\cite{SCARV:LeeFis:05}) the PLX
      design, which, among other concepts, supports 
      a) sub-word parallelism (cf. packed, or SWAR-like operations),
         and
      b) word size scalability (or data-path scalability).
      First, 
      note that a fully sub-word parallel ISA is orthogonal wrt. all useful
      sub-word sizes; PLX supports $n$-byte sub-word sizes for sane $n$.
      Second,
      note that, in a sense, RISC-V is word size scalable: it can cater for
      implementations that, e.g., have a $32$-bit instructions but a $32$-,
      $64$-, or $128$-bit $\GPR$ register file (and so also address space). 
      The same concept is useful wrt. the co-processor, and indeed, for the
      multi-precision operations
      (per \REFSEC{sec:spec:instruction:2:4},
      in particular.

      The current design considers sub-{\em byte} (e.g., $4$-bit), sub-word
      sizes; doing so is motivated, e.g., by their utility in some classes 
      of light-weight block cipher.  However, it does not currently explore 
      the potential of a scalable word size: it assumes the general-purpose
      and $\XCR$ register file word sizes are {\em both} $32$ bits.

\item Consider a general case, wherein a given ISA has instruction formats
      that allow access to $n$ general-purpose registers, st. 
      $
      n = s + d
      $ 
      for $s$ sources and $d$ destinations, meaning an associated encoding 
      must somehow specify $n$ register addresses.  The special case
      $
      n = 3 = 2 + 1 
      $
      is common, and adopted by RISC-V, but it should nevertheless be clear
      that {\em other} cases can also be useful.  A common ``wrinkle'' in a 
      strict $3$-address case is (full) $( w \times w )$-bit multiplication, 
      which produces a $(2 \cdot w )$-bit product and therefore demands use 
      of {\em two} $w$-bit destination registers.
   
      One of the strategies underlying \XCID is support for larger $s$ and
      $d$.  This is rationalised by a (ideally positive) trade-off between
      a) increased register file complexity, as a result of the requirement
         to support $n$ ports, or, alternatively, multi-cycle operations,
         vs.
      b) increased register file bandwidth.
      The latter enables each instruction to perform more, or richer forms 
      of computation, aligning well with the demands of many cryptographic 
      workloads: this essentially matches the concept
      Lee et al.~\cite{SCARV:LeeYanShi:04}
      describe as data-rich execution, supported, in their terminology, by 
      Multi-word Operands, Multi-word Results (MOMR)
      capable computational infrastructure.

      Even {\em if} said trade-off is acceptable, however, it also implies 
      some challenges wrt. instruction encoding.  There seem to be several 
      possible options:

      \begin{enumerate}
      \item One could make all  register addresses {\em explicit}.
            For example, XS1 uses a long (i.e., $32$-bit) $6$-address 
            instruction format~\cite[Page 246]{SCARV:XS1:09} 
            to encode
            \VERB{lmul}~\cite[Page 146]{SCARV:XS1:09}.
      \item One could make some register addresses {\em implicit}.  
            For example, the x86 $( 32 \times 32 )$-bit multiplication 
            instruction 
            \VERB{mul}~\cite[Page 4-144--4-145]{SCARV:X86:2:18} 
            makes implicit uses of \VERB{edx} and \VERB{edx} as destinations.
      \item One could make some register addresses {\em implied}.
            For example, this approach has been considered within the
            specific context of support cryptography: 
            Lee and Choi~\cite{SCARV:LeeCho:08} propose Register File
            Extension for Multi-word and Long-word Operation (RFEMLO), 
            where a group of $n$ contiguous registers is identified by 
            one register address plus a group size (or level in their terminology): 
            address $i$ and level $n$ implies use of registers
            \[
            i, i + 1, i + 2, \ldots i + 2^n - 1 .
            \]
            Note that this approach potentially causes an issue wrt.
            registers with specific semantics.  For example, in many
            RISC-like ISAs (including RISC-V), $\GPR[0]$ is fixed to 
            $0$; it may be difficult to include or exclude $\GPR[0]$ 
            in a group as need be.
      \item One could make some register addresses {\em overloaded}.
            For example, ARMv7-A includes a so-called ``unsigned multiply,
            accumulate accumulate'' instruction 
            \VERB{umaal}~\cite[Section A8.8.255]{SCARV:ARMv7_M:17} 
            whose format {\em suggests} $n = 4 = 2 + 2$ but in fact 
            reuses the two destination as additional sources.
      \end{enumerate}
      
      \noindent
      Note that several of these approaches have an implication for the
      difficulty of register allocation; the obvious example is that of
      implicit register addresses.  Likewise, there are various generic
      ways to mitigate the encoding pressure (i.e., the availability of 
      at most $w$ bits) given an approach.  For example one could
      
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item restrict access to some subset of the register file 
            (cf. ARM Thumb or RV32E) 
            thereby reducing the number of bits required to encode each  
            register address,
            or
      \item use some form of instruction prefix.
      \end{enumerate}

\item The $\XCR$ register file capacity (i.e., the number of constituent
      registers) is a trade-off between quite a number of factors, e.g.,

      \begin{itemize}
      \item increased area, and complexity stemming from implementation
            of the register file,
      \item use of a $16$-element $\XCR$ register file in conjunction
            with RV32E~\cite[Section 3]{SCARV:RV:ISA:I:17} yielding a 
            similar footprint (wrt. this resource at least) to RV32I,
      \item a domain-specific remit suggesting a smaller capacity is 
            viable,
      \item   domain-specific workloads suggest more value from larger 
            registers (i.e., word size), not necessarily larger register
            file capacity,
      \item a smaller capacity reducing instruction encoding pressure.
      \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
